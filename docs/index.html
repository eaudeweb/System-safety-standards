          Standards derived from the IEC 60335 series (the name usually includes
           “Household and similar electrical appliances – Safety”) cover explicitly only system design.
          These standards cover installation, operation and repair indirectly by specifying what is required to be
           written in the manuals of the appliances.
          This indirect coverage is indicated by “X” in the respective cells.
